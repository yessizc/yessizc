I am currently studying analysis and development of information systems in the SENA, I am a technical graduate in industrial safety, but a few years ago I leaned towards the world of software development.
I am a responsible person, punctual, respectful, attentive, I learn very fast and I perform very well in my work, I have also learned development in a self-taught way.
my main hobbies are reading, and anime.
